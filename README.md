# Water_Pump_Classification
Here are my attempts at the competition 'Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table'. The first notebook contains the Explorational data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering, the second notebook contains feature engineering and the third, model building were the following models where used:
* Decision Tree (75.1%),
* K Nearest Neighbor  (77.4%),
* **Random Forest     (80.2%)**,
* Xtreme Gradient Boosting (74.5%),
* Soft Voting Classifier - All Models (79.5%)

Random Forest turns out to be the best model which ranks among the top 17%

The data used and more information can be obtained here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/
